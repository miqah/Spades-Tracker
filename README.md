# Spades-Tracker
SpadesTracker is a desktop application that keeps track of the score in the popular card game Spades. The rules of Spades can be found everywhere online. Spades is a fun game for four players. However, the scoring is oftentimes hard to keep, thus making SpadesTracker great for those looking to play.

I coded SpadesTracker in C# using Visual Studios. Spades Tracker keeps track of every round, who the dealer is, and when a player achieves or loses a Nill hand. The settings allow the users to choose what score the games go to and even how many points those earn or lose when going for a Nill hand. With more updates to come, Spades Tracker is an excellent choice for those looking to make their spades games much more efficient. Give it a try!
